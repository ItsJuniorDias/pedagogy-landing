They learn how to fix things in a spacesuit with gloves so thick you can barely feel your own fingers. They train underwater for hours to practice spacewalks — the water creates the same floating, weightless feeling as space, except there's also a pool.\n\nThey learn Russian, because the International Space Station has Russian crew members and Russian equipment and some very important buttons labelled only in Russian.\n\nThey study medicine, because in space, the doctor is whoever is there.`,

      `Dinosaurs lived during a time called the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. This era is divided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Dinosaurs were incredibly diverse, ranging from small bird-like creatures to massive sauropods that could reach lengths of over 100 feet. They lived in various environments, from lush forests to arid deserts, and they were the dominant land animals for over 160 million years.`,
      `The Mesozoic Era was a time of great change. The continents were arranged differently than they are today, and the climate was generally warmer. Dinosaurs evolved to fill many different ecological niches — some were herbivores that grazed on plants, while others were carnivores that hunted other animals. Some dinosaurs even developed feathers, which may have been used for insulation or display.`,
      `Despite their long reign, dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago, likely due to a combination of factors including a massive asteroid impact and volcanic activity. However, their legacy lives on in the form of birds, which are considered modern-day dinosaurs. So the next time you see a bird, remember that you're looking at a distant relative of the mighty dinosaurs!`,

      `There are many famous dinosaurs that have captured our imagination. The Tyrannosaurus rex, often called T. rex, was a massive carnivore with powerful jaws and tiny arms. The Triceratops was a herbivore known for its three horns and large frill. The Velociraptor was a small but fast predator that likely hunted in packs. The Brachiosaurus was a giant sauropod with a long neck that allowed it to reach high vegetation.`,
      `Each of these dinosaurs had unique adaptations that helped them survive in their environments. For example, the T. rex's strong legs allowed it to run at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour, while the Triceratops' horns were likely used for defense against predators. The Velociraptor's sharp claws were perfect for catching prey, and the Brachiosaurus' long neck allowed it to access food sources that other dinosaurs couldn't reach.`,

    pages: [
      `The extinction of dinosaurs is one of the most significant events in Earth's history. It occurred about 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. The leading theory for their extinction is that a massive asteroid impact caused widespread environmental changes, including wildfires, tsunamis, and a 'nuclear winter' effect that blocked sunlight and disrupted ecosystems.`,
      `In addition to the asteroid impact, there were also massive volcanic eruptions around the same time, which may have contributed to the extinction by releasing large amounts of volcanic gases and ash into the atmosphere. These events would have led to a rapid decline in temperatures and a collapse of food chains, making it difficult for dinosaurs to survive.`,
      `While the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct, their legacy lives on through birds, which are considered their closest living relatives. The extinction event also paved the way for mammals to diversify and eventually led to the rise of humans. So while it's sad that dinosaurs are no longer with us, their story is an important part of our planet's history and continues to inspire curiosity and wonder!`,

      `The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet.\n\nIf you looked at Earth from space and didn't know its name, you might call it the Blue Planet — because that's mostly what it is. More blue than green, more water than land, more unexplored than explored.\n\nHumans have mapped the surface of the Moon in greater detail than we've mapped the bottom of our own ocean. The deep sea is one of the last great mysteries on Earth — full of creatures that have never been seen, living in pressure and darkness that would crush an unprotected human instantly.\n\nAnd yet, life is absolutely everywhere down there.`,
      `The ocean is not one place. It's many.\n\nThe sunlit zone, just below the surface, is where most ocean life lives — where coral reefs bloom in impossible colours and fish dart through shafts of light. Go deeper and you reach the twilight zone, where only the faintest blue light filters down and creatures glow with their own cold light. Deeper still is the midnight zone, where there is no sunlight at all, just the slow drift of marine snow — tiny particles of dead organic matter falling like an endless silent snowstorm.\n\nAnd at the very bottom: the trenches. The deepest place on Earth, the Mariana Trench, is nearly 11 kilometres down. If you placed Mount Everest inside it, the peak would still be underwater.`,
      `The ocean is also the oldest home of life on Earth.\n\nBefore there were forests or insects or dinosaurs — before there was anything breathing air — the ocean was already full. The first single-celled life forms appeared in the ocean about 3.5 billion years ago. Everything that crawled onto land eventually came from there.\n\nWhen you swim in the sea, you are swimming in life's original home.\n\nThat seems worth remembering.`,

      `Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor.\n\nAnd yet they are home to more than 25% of all marine species.\n\nThink about that proportion for a moment. One percent of the space, a quarter of all the life. Coral reefs are the most biodiverse ecosystems in the ocean — possibly on the entire planet. They are sometimes called the rainforests of the sea, which gives you a sense of how packed with life they are.\n\nAnd here is the strangest thing: coral is not a plant. It is not a rock. It is an animal.`,
      `A coral reef is built by tiny animals called polyps.\n\nEach polyp is soft-bodied and smaller than your fingernail. It builds a hard skeleton of calcium carbonate around itself for protection — and when it dies, that skeleton remains. Millions of polyps, building and dying and building again over thousands of years, create a structure large enough to see from space.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef off Australia's coast is the largest living structure on Earth. It has been growing for around 20,000 years.\n\nIn a way, a coral reef is a cathedral built by creatures too small to see with the naked eye.`,
      `Coral reefs are also in danger.\n\nRising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching — when the ocean gets too warm, corals expel the colourful algae that live inside them and turn white. Without those algae, they slowly starve. If temperatures drop again in time, the coral can recover. If they don't, it dies.\n\nScientists are working on ways to protect and restore reefs — breeding heat-resistant coral, reducing pollution, establishing marine protected areas. It's difficult, careful work.\n\nBut the reefs have survived for millions of years. With help, they can survive this too.`,

The firefly squid covers itself in tiny light organs and pulses with blue-green flashes. The deep-sea jellyfish glows violet and crimson and drifts like a paper lantern in the black water.\n\nThe deep sea, with no sun at all, is full of light.`,
      `The pressure in the deep ocean is crushing.\n\nAt the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the pressure is more than 1,000 times what we feel at the surface — equivalent to having 50 jumbo jets stacked on top of you. No human-made vessel can go there without special engineering. Our bodies would be destroyed instantly.\n\nAnd yet: there are fish down there. Shrimp. Worms. Creatures with no eyes because eyes are useless in a place where there is nothing to see. Creatures that have evolved over millions of years to thrive in conditions that would kill everything familiar to us.\n\nLife, it turns out, finds a way — even at the bottom of everything.`,
      `The deep sea is also where we find hydrothermal vents.\n\nThese are cracks in the ocean floor where superheated water, rich with minerals, shoots up from inside the Earth. The water can be over 400 degrees Celsius — but it doesn't boil, because the pressure is so intense.\n\nAround these vents, without any sunlight at all, entire ecosystems thrive. Giant tube worms nearly two metres long. Eyeless crabs. Ghostly fish. These creatures get their energy not from the Sun, but from the chemicals in the water — a process called chemosynthesis.\n\nThis discovery changed how scientists think about life everywhere — including the possibility of life on other worlds.`,

It is being saved, one protected area, one cleaned beach, one changed fishing practice at a time.`,
      `What can you do?\n\nQuite a lot, actually.\n\nReduce the plastic you use — especially single-use plastic that ends up in waterways. Eat seafood from sustainable sources. Learn about the ocean and tell other people what you've learned, because knowledge is one of the most powerful tools we have.\n\nAnd go to the sea if you can. Stand at the edge of it. Watch the waves come in. Remember that what you're looking at is 3.5 billion years old, and home to more life than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nThe ocean has been here longer than humans.

      `Here is a secret about colour: it isn't really in the objects at all.\n\nColour is light. When light hits an object, the object absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others.

It's red because it reflects the wavelengths of light that your brain interprets as red.\n\nThe apple in the dark has no colour at all.

But from those three, if you're patient and curious, you can mix almost every other colour in the world.\n\nArtists have known this for hundreds of years. So have babies staring at bright objects for the first time. There's something satisfying about primary colours — something complete.`,
      `When you mix two primary colours, you get a secondary colour.\n\nRed + Yellow = Orange.\nBlue + Yellow = Green.\nRed + Blue = Purple (or violet, depending on the exact shades).\n\nThree primaries make three secondaries, and suddenly you have six colours where you started with three. Then you can mix adjacent colours together to get tertiaries — red-orange, yellow-green, blue-violet — and suddenly six becomes twelve.\n\nThis is called the colour wheel, and it's one of the most useful things anyone ever drew in a circle.`,
      `Mixing colours is one of those things that never gets boring.\n\nBecause you can always add more. A tiny drop of blue into green makes a deeper, colder colour — like the sea on a cloudy day. A little white makes colours lighter and softer — pastels, like the inside of a shell. A little black deepens a colour into shadow.\n\nEvery artist who has ever lived has spent time just... mixing.

You look at something that someone else made — something beautiful or strange or just interesting — and you try to do what they did, and in the trying, you learn things your hands didn't know before.\n\nBut copying is a beginning, not a destination. At some point, almost without noticing, you start making choices. Changing things. Taking what you've learned and using it to say something only you would say.\n\nThat is when you become an artist.`,
      `There is no correct way to make art.\n\nThis sounds obvious, but it's easy to forget when you're looking at your drawing and thinking it doesn't look right.\n\nDoesn't look right compared to what? Compared to a photograph? But photography already exists — art doesn't need to compete with it. Compared to what someone else made? But you are not them, and you are not trying to be.\n\nThe question is not whether your drawing looks right. The question is whether it looks like you meant it to look. Whether it contains something true about the thing you were seeing, or the feeling you had, or the world the way it looks from exactly where you're standing.\n\nThat standard is much more interesting.`,
      `Art is a way of paying attention.\n\nWhen you draw something — really draw it, looking closely — you notice things you'd never noticed before. The exact way the light falls on the left side of a mug. The small asymmetry in a face that makes it feel like a real face and not a face in a book.\n\nYou can look at something a thousand times without seeing it. The act of drawing makes you see it, maybe for the first time.\n\nThis is the real gift of learning to make art: not the drawings you produce, but the way it changes how you look at everything else.\n\nYou start seeing the world differently.\n\nAnd once you start, you can't stop.`,

      `A scientist is someone who asks: what if I'm wrong?\n\nThat sounds like a strange thing to want to be. Most of us prefer to be right. But the best scientists in the world have made peace with the possibility of being wrong — because being wrong, and finding out why, is how you get to the truth.\n\nScience is not a collection of facts. It is a method — a set of steps for finding things out, designed specifically to catch mistakes before they spread.\n\nThe steps are: wonder, guess, test, look closely, and be honest about what you find.`,
      `The scientific method starts with a question.\n\nNot just any question — a testable one. "Why is the sky blue?" is a question, but a better question for science is: "Does the sky look bluer at noon than at sunset, and if so, why?"\n\nA testable question leads to a hypothesis — your best guess at the answer, based on what you already know. The hypothesis isn't supposed to be correct. It's supposed to be specific enough to test.\n\nThen you do the experiment. You collect the evidence. And then — this is the crucial part — you look at what actually happened, not what you wanted to happen.\n\nThe difference between those two things is where science lives.`,
      `Science is full of stories of things being wrong in useful ways.\n\nPenicillin was discovered because Alexander Fleming noticed mould contaminating a petri dish — and instead of throwing it away, wondered why the bacteria around the mould had died. The entire field of geology changed when Alfred Wegener noticed that the coastlines of South America and Africa looked like puzzle pieces that might fit together.\n\nThe discovery wasn't the plan. The discovery was the noticing.\n\nGood scientists are not just people who know a lot. They are people who notice. Who stay curious even when the answer is not what they expected. Who ask: isn't that strange?\n\nYou can start practising right now.`,

This repeats until the fizz runs out.",

      `Everything you can touch, see, smell, or taste is made of matter.\n\nThe chair you're sitting on. The air you're breathing. The water you drink, the light of a candle, the warmth of a sunbeam — all matter, all made of tiny particles that we call atoms. Atoms are so small that a single grain of sand contains more atoms than there are grains of sand on all of Earth's beaches.\n\nAtoms join together to form molecules. Molecules join together in different arrangements to form everything that exists. The same atoms, arranged differently, can be coal or diamonds. Carbon, just arranged differently.\n\nMatter is not fixed. It transforms.`,
      `Matter exists in three main states: solid, liquid, and gas.\n\nIn a solid, the particles are packed tightly together and vibrate in place — like a crowd of people in an elevator, not going anywhere but still moving slightly. In a liquid, particles have more energy and can move around each other freely — like people in a crowded room, shuffling, rearranging. In a gas, particles have so much energy they zoom around freely in all directions, spreading to fill whatever space they're in.\n\nThe same substance can be all three. Water is ice (solid), water (liquid), and steam (gas) — depending entirely on temperature. The particles are identical. Only the energy has changed.`,
      `Changes of state are happening everywhere, all the time.\n\nWhen you breathe on a cold morning and see your breath — that's the water vapour in your warm breath condensing into tiny liquid droplets when it hits the cold air. When a puddle disappears on a sunny day — that's evaporation, liquid water gaining enough energy to become gas. When dew appears on grass in the early morning — that's condensation again, water vapour in the cooled night air settling back into liquid.\n\nThe water cycle — rain, rivers, oceans, clouds, rain again — is just matter changing state over and over, moved by the energy of the Sun.\n\nIt has been cycling for 4.5 billion years. The water in your glass is very, very old.`,

The air rushing out of the balloon pushes backward; the reaction force pushes the balloon forward. This is exactly how real rocket engines work — just with burning fuel instead of air.",

      `Forces are pushes and pulls.\n\nThat's the whole definition. Every force is either something pushing or something pulling. Gravity pulls everything towards every other thing with mass — right now, you and the Earth are pulling each other. You pull the Earth up (very slightly), and the Earth pulls you down (much more noticeably).\n\nFriction is a force that resists movement — it's why a rolling ball eventually stops, why you can grip things with your hands, why rubbing sticks together creates heat. Without friction, nothing would stay still. Everything would slide forever.\n\nAnd yet too much friction slows things down, costs energy, wears things out. The science of engineering is largely the science of managing forces — deciding which ones to use, which ones to reduce.`,
      `Isaac Newton was one of the greatest scientists who ever lived.\n\nHe was sitting under an apple tree when an apple fell and hit him on the head — or so the story goes. (It probably happened, but probably wasn't quite so dramatic.) The apple didn't tell him anything new, exactly — people had known things fell for as long as there were people. But Newton asked a different question: why does the apple fall toward the Earth? And why doesn't the Moon?\n\nHis answer — gravity, pulling everything toward everything else at a calculable rate — explained both. The Moon is falling toward Earth, constantly. But it's also moving sideways fast enough that it keeps missing. That's what an orbit is: perpetual falling while perpetually missing the thing you're falling toward.`,
      `Motion follows rules.\n\nNewton wrote them down in three laws that engineers still use today:\n\nFirst: an object at rest stays at rest. An object in motion stays in motion. Nothing changes without a force.\n\nSecond: the bigger the force, the more the acceleration. The heavier the object, the more force it takes to move.\n\nThird: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nThese three sentences explain why rockets fly, why brakes stop cars, why you feel pushed back into your seat when a car accelerates. The Universe runs by them.\n\nNewton wrote them in 1687. We haven't needed to change them since.`,

A sealed bottle can sustain a plant for months or even years. The bottle is a tiny closed ecosystem.",

      `Life is hard to define. But easy to recognise.\n\nScientists use a checklist: living things are made of cells, they grow, they respond to their environment, they reproduce, they use energy, and they produce waste. By these rules, a bacterium is alive and a fire is not, even though fire moves, spreads, uses fuel, and produces waste.\n\nBut the checklist misses something — the fact that life is not just a collection of properties. It's a system. Living things are connected to everything around them in webs of dependence so intricate that pulling on any one thread pulls everything else.\n\nEcology is the science of those connections.`,
      `An ecosystem is a community of living things interacting with each other and with their non-living environment.\n\nThe non-living parts matter enormously: temperature, sunlight, soil composition, rainfall, altitude. Different combinations of these create radically different places — tropical rainforests with layered canopies and millions of species, polar tundra where only the hardiest organisms survive, deep ocean vents where life thrives without any sunlight at all.\n\nWithin each ecosystem, energy flows from producers (plants, which capture sunlight) to consumers (animals, which eat plants or each other) to decomposers (fungi and bacteria, which break down what dies and return it to the soil).\n\nNothing is wasted. Everything cycles.`,
      `The web of life is more fragile and more resilient than it looks.\n\nFragile, because removing one key species can collapse an ecosystem entirely. In the 1950s, China's Great Sparrow Campaign eliminated hundreds of millions of sparrows, which were eating grain. Without sparrows to eat them, insect populations exploded. The insects ate the crops. Famine followed. A chain of consequences no one had foreseen.\n\nResilient, because ecosystems that are given space and time can recover from severe damage. Forests regrow. Rivers clean themselves. Species thought locally extinct reappear.\n\nThe natural world has been solving problems for 3.5 billion years. It knows things we don't.\n\nThe best science pays attention to what it's already figured out.`,
